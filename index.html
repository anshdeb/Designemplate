			<h1>What is Designemplate?</h1>
			<p>Designemplate is a stylish CSS template for rapid development.</p>
			<p>Ever needed to quickly develop a basic webpage? Ever needed to develop a basic "Under Maintinance" page? Designemplate allows the developer to quickly develop small webpages without having to worry about aesthetics. You simply copy in Designemplate, tell it what you want and you're good to go!</p>
			<p>Using Designemplate is similar to writing your CSS yourself, just a lot easier and a lot quicker. Designemplate is a great tool for basic webpages or the starting point for a full blown site. You can design how things look (to a degree), without having to learn design. Designemplate has all the spacing, responsive design, colours, features and more. All you have to do, is tell it what you want.</p>
